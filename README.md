# What do we want?

To be able to record fuel usage for our car.
 
## Home screen
 
Big 'ol button with a pump icon and a dropdown to select which car we want to top up. Something like this:

```
+--------+
| Which^ |
|        |
|  +-+   |
|  |F|   |
|  +-+   |
|        |
+--------+
```

## Fill screen

A clean form where you can enter:

 * Trip mileage (or km-age)
 * Odometer
 * Fuel amount (litre or gallon for our 'murican pals)
 * Fuel price
 * Total paid
 
You don't have to full all fields. It's enough to fill trip mileage or odometer. And fuel amount. And Fuel price or total paid.

Alternatively, a camera button to take photo of the till and with an OCR library, autofill the form (test efficiency of this)

## New car form

 * Reg number
 * Brand
 * Type
 * Color
 * Diesel/petrol/gas/hybrid/electric
